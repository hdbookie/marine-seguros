# Quick Ways to Share Your Marine Seguros Analytics Platform

Since ngrok requires email verification, here are alternative methods to share a preview with your client:

## Option 1: LocalTunnel (No Account Required) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
```bash
# Install localtunnel
npm install -g localtunnel

# Run your Streamlit app
streamlit run app_enhanced_v2.py

# In a new terminal, create tunnel
lt --port 8501

# You'll get a URL like: https://xxxxx.loca.lt
# Share this URL with your client
```

## Option 2: Screen Recording (Quickest)
```bash
# On Mac, use built-in screen recording:
# Press Cmd + Shift + 5
# Record your demo of the app
# Share the video file via email/cloud
```

## Option 3: VS Code Tunnels (If you have VS Code)
```bash
# Open the project in VS Code
# Press Cmd + Shift + P
# Type "Forward a Port"
# Forward port 8501
# Share the generated URL
```

## Option 4: Streamlit Cloud (Free, 5 minutes)
1. Push your code to GitHub (create private repo)
2. Go to share.streamlit.io
3. Deploy from your GitHub repo
4. Share the public URL

## Option 5: Temporary Cloud Deployment
```bash
# Using Railway.app (free tier)
# 1. Create account at railway.app
# 2. Install Railway CLI
# 3. Run: railway login
# 4. Run: railway init
# 5. Run: railway up
```

## Security Note for Client
When sharing, let your client know:
- The data is processed locally on their machine
- Only AI queries are sent to Google (not the financial data)
- The preview link will be temporary

## Quickest Solution Right Now:
Since you just want to give a preview, I recommend Option 1 (LocalTunnel) or Option 2 (Screen Recording).
