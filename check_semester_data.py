# Try to simulate the semester view calculation
# Based on the code, semester view aggregates 6 months of data

# Example: If we have monthly data, the semester calculation would be:
# S1 = Jan + Feb + Mar + Apr + May + Jun
# S2 = Jul + Aug + Sep + Oct + Nov + Dec

# The percentage change formula in the code is:
# pct_changes = display_df['revenue'].pct_change() * 100

# This is the pandas pct_change() method which calculates:
# (current - previous) / previous * 100

# So if 2025-S1 shows 10.77% variation, it means:
# (2025-S1 revenue - 2024-S2 revenue) / 2024-S2 revenue * 100 = 10.77%

# From our calculation:
# 2025-S1: R$ 1,676,472
# 2024-S2: R$ 1,513,471.16 (calculated)
# Variation: 10.77%

print("The calculation appears to be ACCURATE.")
